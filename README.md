My name is Nathan Stohlmann and I am a LEGO enthusiast, PowerShell advocate, Euphonium proponent, and DevOps specialist.

Almost all of the public projects in my personal account are at most half finished because I get distracted by so many things in my daily life and live as examples in stark contrast to the many projects in my work life that live, grow, and thrive often to the detriment of the aforesaid personal projects.
